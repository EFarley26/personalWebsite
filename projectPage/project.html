                    As a part of my final project in my Fundamentals of Computing class, I recreated the popular
                     video game Candy Crush in C using X11 forwarding as the graphical engine. The game recognizes
                     matches of three, four, and five in a row, scoring the player accordingly, with the goal of
                     getting the highest score after 20 moves. I love playing the game and had even more fun coding it.

                <p id="moneyBallBody" class="projectBody">
                    Over the 2023 summer, I had the opportunity to study aboard in London, England with the University
                     of Notre Dame.  I took a Machine Learning class where I learned how to create my own LLMs (large
                     language models). For my final project in the class, I worked with a team to create a model that
                     identified which exit velocities and launch angles were most likely to produce an MLB homerun. To
                     develop the most accurate model, supervised learning was used alongside binary classification and
                     logistic regression.

                    This was a personal project that I made to have some fun with my Wordle-obsessed friends. I wrote
                     the Bot in Python, and I grabbed a Scrabble list of English 5-letter words as my dictionary. The
                     user inputs their guess, including the yellow and green responses from the Wordle app, and the
                     program spits back the next best guess.  It ranks guesses by giving each letter in every possible
                     guess a commonality score, and the word with the most common letters is recommended as the next guess.
                     This method gets me the correct answer in 3-4 guesses every time.

                    This was a game I made in high school as a part of my AP Computer Science class. Written in P5,
                     a graphical language that builds on JavaScript, I took inspiration from recently released games
                     like Eldin Ring to create a small adventure for the player. The game includes multiple maps, enemy
                     types, and ways to beat the game all incorporated using various classes.
