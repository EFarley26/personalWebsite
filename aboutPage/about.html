                    Hi! My name is Ethan Farley
                </h1>
                <p> I am a junior at the University of Notre Dame, majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in
                     Cloud Computing, a minor in Collaborative Innovation & Design. I am also an Engineering Grand
                     Challenges Scholar and a Fellow in Notre Dame‚Äôs IDEA Center, where I am developing hands-on experience
                     with innovation and entrepreneurship through ND-backed start-ups.   
                </p>

                <p> I‚Äôm proficient in Python, C, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Shell, HTML, and MATLAB, and I‚Äôm passionate
                     about crafting solutions that prioritize user experience and innovation. I have loved adding Design as
                     my minor, and I believe it will enhance my full set of skills as a software engineer.
                </p>

                <p> Currently, I‚Äôm pursuing a summer 2025 internship where I can contribute to impactful projects, continue
                     learning, and grow within a fast-paced team environment. With hands-on experience from my recent product
                     engineering internship, I‚Äôm seeking opportunities to further develop my software engineering skills.
                </p>

                Why Computer Science?
            </h1>
            <p> I‚Äôve always enjoyed math and science, and I started taking computer science courses in high school and I
                 really took off from there. I love algorithms and the critical thinking that is used while coding and to
                 solve logic problems. To me they are like a puzzle that I get invested in and spend hours solving. 
            </p>
            <p>My junior year of high school I was tutoring several students online when I realized that I could reinvent
                 the tutoring process at my school, to focus on building connections between people, making it simpler and
                 more accessible for students to find help. I wanted to build an online platform, so I started by learning:
                 I joined an online tutoring organization, researched websites for inspiration, and talked to founders of
                 non-profits. I leveraged existing code, configured a custom website, developed templates, and wrote macros
                 to collect and integrate data.  A few months later I launched SW-Tutors to my entire high school, where
                 hundreds of tutors and students enrolled.  
            </p>
            <p> My project had an immediate impact, and it was one I hadn‚Äôt envisioned. My first tutoring request wasn‚Äôt from
                 a student, but from our special-needs teacher who wanted tutors to build relationships with her students.
                 This confirmed something for me -- technology alone doesn‚Äôt solve problems, it‚Äôs connecting people to each
                 other through the technology that is the secret. Technology can infuse diverse and inclusive perspectives
                 into our lives; it can enhance our humanity if we design and use it purposefully. 
            </p>
            <p> This is what I want to do. I believe this goal, connecting people through technology, will solve problems that
                 span industries, businesses, and non-profits. I am excited to continue building my future!
            </p>

                    <h3> üå≤ Seattle </h3>
                    <p>I grew up in Seattle, Washington, but have grown to love the Notre Dame campus in Indiana, as well
                         as occasional trips into Chicago. While studying abroad in London and Dublin, I have really enjoyed
                         the opportunity to explore new places and experience new cultures. Over the past three years I have
                         backpacked to 8 countries. I am looking forward to an upcoming trip to Troms√∏, Norway to experience
                         the Northern Lights. 
                    </p>

                    <h3> üéµ Music </h3>
                    <p> I love music, it has always been a big part of my life. I played the bassoon and the clarinet for 8
                         years and played in my high school Wind Ensemble. Additionally, I was a part of the Marching and
                          Pep Bands and joined the Orchestra for performances. I have loved exploring the Irish music scene
                           and the ability to find musicians on pretty much every street corner and pub in Dublin.   
                    </p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3> üéæ Sport </h3>
                    <p> I love sports of all kinds, for physical fitness and for camaraderie. For most of my life I‚Äôve
                         played competitive soccer, tennis, and basketball. In college I started playing intramural
                         football, volleyball, basketball and more tennis. I like to win, but to me sports has always
                         been about spending time with friends. Here in Dublin, I‚Äôve joined the DCU basketball club team
                         to stay active and I. recently got the chance to try hurling, a traditional Irish sport!

                    <h3> üèûÔ∏è Favorite Place in Ireland </h3>
                    <p> My favorite place I‚Äôve visited so far has to be the Coumshingaun Lough hiking trail my friends and
                         I visited a couple weekends ago. It took us all day to get there, requiring us to bike, hike, and
                         walk around 18 miles but the views were incredible, and we got to swim in the mountain top lake,
                         which made it worth the trip and made the burgers in the pub even better at the end of the day.

                <div class="card">
                    <h3> üöµ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Weekends </h3>
                    <p> Currently I love spending my weekend exploring the music scene in Ireland but back in Seattle
                         I recently took up mountain biking and really love it, especially exploring all of the trails
                         and terrain parks in the Pacific Northwest. It‚Äôs a great way for me to stay active and stay
                         connected with my friends.

                    <h3> ü•® Snacks </h3>
                    <p> My go to snack is 100% pretzels with either a kombucha or a sparking water on the side. This
                         snack reminds me a lot of growing up as a kid and helps me stay focused while working.

                    <h3> ‚ù§Ô∏è Community Service </h3>
                    <p>I enjoy volunteering in the communities I live in. At Notre Dame I participate in our Service
                         Days and events, like ND 110. In Seattle I was part of the TIPS (Teens in Public Service)
                         program where I served as an instructor for the Center for Wooden Boats on Seattle‚Äôs busy Lake
                         Union. I taught kids how to sail and I managed the summer interns. I absolutely loved it.
                         Teaching is something that has always come naturally to me, and something that I enjoy.
