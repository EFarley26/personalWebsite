                <p class="newsBody"> I am super excited to be spending my 2024 Fall semester studying abroad in Dublin,
                     Ireland at Dublin City University (DCU). I am taking a variety of Computer Science classes from Advanced
                     Web Design and Computer Architecture to Data Science & Data bases. I am also taking a course in Irish
                     History. Outside of the classroom, I’ve enjoyed escaping the city and venturing into the countryside see
                     and experience all the culture Ireland has to offer.  I recently had the chance to spend a week shadowing
                     engineers and innovators at Accenture’s Dock offices in Ireland, getting a peak at how they are applying
                     AI across multiple industry business scenarios.   </p>

                <p class="newsBody"> Over my 2024 summer break, I had the wonderful opportunity to work with Xenon Arc as an
                     Engineering Software Intern. Xenon Arc is a chemical and food ingredient distributor and reseller that
                     helps large organizations reach and serve the SMB market with personalized support to drive growth. I
                     had the amazing chance to put my HTML, JavaScript, and CSS skills to work when I helped redesigned their
                     Conntact product, a website intended to drive company growth and sales for customers. I also built
                     skills in Microsoft Dynamics 365 when I supported their customer data migration and created new data
                     import processes. I learned so much from my colleagues at Xenon Arc and had a fantastic time.   </p>

                <p class="newsHeader"> Grand Challenges Scholars Program </p>
                <p class="newsBody"> I am thrilled to announce that I have been accepted into the Notre Dame Grand Challenges
                     Scholars Program. The program helps prepare engineering students to tackle pressing global challenges
                     through interdisciplinary education, research, entrepreneurship, global experiences, and service learning.
                     I have chosen to focus on the intersection of technology and the education industry where I believe AI can
                     revolutionize the way students are taught and lessons are developed by helping each student learn in a
                     more individualized way that best suits their needs. Leveraging technology in new ways will also help us
                     address the growing teacher-student challenges.
                </p>

                <p class="newsBody"> As an Engineering Grand Challenges honors scholar, I explore the intersection of AI and VR/XR in the
                    education industry, aiming to create transformative experiences through cutting-edge technology that give
                    students a more personalize and effective learning journey.
